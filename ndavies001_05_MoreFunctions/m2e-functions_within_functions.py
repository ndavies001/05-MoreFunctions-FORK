#   As you saw in the quiz for today's class, functions can call other
#   functions.
#
#   Go through this code line by line and predict what will be printed. Notice
#   how the first line that runs is actually the last line "main()", because it
#   is the first line that is not part of a definition. This line calls the
#   main() function which then gets the ball rolling.
#
#   Once you have made a prediction of what will print when this code runs, run
#   it for yourself.
#
#   If you are surpirsed by anything try to figure out why it did what it did.
#   If you get stuck please ask questions.
#
#   Once you understand this code, then move on to the next module.
